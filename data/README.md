# Data Notes

- This repository does **not** include real patient-level data.
- Use `make_dummy_data.py` to generate a small synthetic multi-omics dataset with TNBC-like signal.
- When running with real data:
  - Keep identifiers outside the repo.
  - Provide file paths via `config.yaml` or environment variables.
  - Ensure compliance with your IRB/ethics approvals.
